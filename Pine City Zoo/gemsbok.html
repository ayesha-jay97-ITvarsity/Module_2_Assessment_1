                        <h3> GEMSBOKS </h3>

                        <p> The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (<i>Oryx gazella</i>) is a large antelope in the
                            genus <i>Oryx</i>. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari 
                            Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>

                        <p> The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the
                            species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>

                        <p> Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (3.9 ft) at the shoulder.
                            The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm 
                            (18 to 35 in). Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb), while females weigh 
                            100–210 kg (220–460 lb). </p>

                        <p> Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. From a 
                            distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters 
                            mistake females for males each year. In males, horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females 
                            have slightly longer, thinner horns.</p>

                        <p> Female gemsbok use their horns to defend themselves and their offspring from predators, while males 
                            primarily use their horns to defend their territories from other males.</p>

                        <p> Gemsbok are one of the few antelope species where female trophies are sometimes more desirable than male
                            ones. A gemsbok horn can be fashioned into a natural trumpet and, according to some authorities, can be 
                            used as a shofar.</p>

                        <strong><p> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM </p></strong>

                        <p> You will find the gemsbok at pen G6, right next to the pandas.</p>
